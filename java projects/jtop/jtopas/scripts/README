Prior to the installation of jtopas program, you need to set the following
variables and classpath: 
 
    - experiment_root :  
      Set environment variable experiment_root to point to the parent directory 
      of the subject directory by typing "setenv experiment_root <path>"
      For example, assume you have a subject directory "jtopas" and you 
      locate it under /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments, then you would give 
      the command:

        setenv experiment_root /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments

    - CLASSPATH : 

	${experiment_root}/jtopas/source:
	$experiment_root/jtopas/source/junit:
	$experiment_root/jtopas/source/lib/junit.jar:.

1. Installation.

   - original version: 
	install.sh orig version_number 
	(version_number: 0, 1, 2, or 3)

   - seeded version: 
	install_seeded.sh version_number  --> used when you build fault matrix.
	(version_number: 1, 2, or 3)
					       
2. Run tests.

   - TestScripts directory contains testscripts that run test case.
     The first line of a testscript file defines CLASSPATH, so you need
     to modify this line to adjust your environment. 

   - Copy testscript file into current directory (~jtopas/scripts) and 
     run testscript in that directory.
