Changes in the JTopas Project:
------------------------------

Version 0.3:
------------
- the collection classes and interfaces of JDK 1.2 are used instead of the 
  Vector and Hashtable classes of JDK 1.x. The Tokenizer interface changed
  therefore: instead of Enumeration the nicer Interface Iterator is used
- The InputStreamTokenizer works with java.io.Reader instances rather than with
  java.io.InputStreamReader ones only
- it is now possible to change from one java.io.Reader to another. E.g. a list 
  of files can be processed with one InputStreamTokenizer instance
- a bug in completing line comments before EOF or run-out-of-data situations has
  been fixed
- the de.susebox.jtopas package with the PluginTokenizer is introduced. It 
  allows user-supplied handler methods for more efficient parsing of special
  sequences, whitespaces and more
- more performant whitespace handling has been implemented in AbstractTokenizer.
- a skip method is added to AbstractTokenizer
- a public readMore method is added to AbstractTokenizer to enable an explicite
  call for more data.
- the secure method getChar has got an equivalent getCharUnchecked that skips
  the bounds checking but is faster than getChar.

Version 0.2:
------------
- a bug in the embedded-tokenizers feature was fixed. It
  occured, when the input buffer had to be reallocated.
- the HTML and CSS sources of the JTopas website on sourceforge.net
  was included in the release
- CVS and helper files are excluded from jtopas archive

Version 0.1:
------------
This is the initial version
